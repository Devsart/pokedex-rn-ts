This project intends to help you organize and customize your favorites Pokémon.  
How can you do it? It's very simple!  
You, as user, can catch a photo from your camera or select a picture from the gallery and you just have  
to choose what's your pokemon and what evolution you want for it. The app will automatically get the data about this  
Pokémon!
